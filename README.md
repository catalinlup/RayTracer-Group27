# RayTracer-Group27
The Final Project for the Year 2 Computer Graphics Course at TU Delft.

## Brief Overview of Team Structure and Organization

Since the issues usually represent very specific programming tasks, most issues will have one programmer assigned to them. Each github issue corresponds to a project feature, except for the acceleration data structures, which are divided into 2 issues.

Bonus features can freely be tackled and added by any of the team members. Nevertheless, if you are planning on working on a specific bonus feature, please create a github issue and assign yourself to it, in order to avoid work overlap.

In case one of the team members does not finish one of his issues by the required deadline, and it is determined that the issue in cause is crucial to the development of the project, another team member is allowed to take his issue.

All features are being developed in their own separate branches. Once a feature is ready, it should be reviewed by the other 2 team members, and if it is determined to be satisfactory, it should be merged to the development branch. The master branch should only contain fully working versions of the project.

Please write a full presentation of your feature in the github issue description. At the end, we will collect all github issue descriptions and create the final report out of them.

## Dates and Deadlines

### Meeting 1 - Sun, 11th of October, 18:30
- we make sure everyone understands the assignment, as well as how the project is organized (15 mins)
- we divide the compulsory issues (15 mins)

### Meeting 2 (deadline) - Wed, 14th of October, 21:00
The following isssues should be done by this deadline:
- the phong illumination model
- the recursive ray tracer
- the first half of the implementation for the acceleration data structures (the construction of the data structure)

We will have a brief meeting, to merge everything together and make sure that the project works.

### Meeting 3 (deadline) - Sat, 17th of October, 18:30
The following issues should be done by this deadline:
- hard shadows
- soft shadows with spherical lights
- the second half of the acceleration data structures (checking the intersection with the ray)
We will have a brief meeting, to merge everything together and make sure that the project works.

### Meeting 4 (deadline) - Sat, 24th of October, 18:30
All bonus features should have been added by this deadline and the project should be fully finished.
During the meeting we merge all of our branches together and we write the final report (which should be easy, since  we will only need to copy paste all of the feature descriptions into one document)

### Meeting 5 (deadline) - Wed, 27th of October, 21:00
All of the small mistakes or bugs should have been solved by now.
The meeting will mainly consist of submitting the project.
